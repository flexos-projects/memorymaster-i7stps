# Project Overview

## Vision

Master any language with intelligent flashcards, spaced repetition, and a vibrant community.

## Problem

Traditional language learning methods often struggle with effective vocabulary retention and consistent practice. Learners forget words quickly, find it hard to track their progress, and lack engaging tools to make the learning process efficient and enjoyable, leading to demotivation and abandonment.

## Solution

MemoryMaster provides an intuitive flashcard platform powered by a spaced repetition algorithm, ensuring optimal learning intervals for maximum retention. Users can create custom decks, leverage integrated audio pronunciation, track detailed mastery stats, and engage with a global community through shareable content, making language acquisition sticky and fun.

## Target User

Independent language learners, students, and polyglots (aged 16-45) who are self-motivated but need structured, intelligent tools to efficiently expand and retain their vocabulary. They are comfortable with technology and value community-driven content.
